# How to Use This Repository
This repository contains a template for implementing a data management plan.  
The purpose of the repository is to allow different groups to easily make edits and create their own webpages using their plan.
The steps below will walk you through using the template and GitHub to accomplish this.


## Set Up A Github Repository
 You will need a Github account in order to complete this guide and can create one [here](hhttps://github.com/join)
  * Note: the url for the webpage will use either the username or organization name which sets it up.
  * ie this projects url is https://landonma.github.io because landonma created it
  * Github pages does take some time to respond to edits and pages being created, so wait 3-5 minutes after making changes before assuming something went wrong
Next you will need to create a new repository by going [here](https://github.com/new).
* in order to set it up for pages give the use name the repository *username*.github.io ,  where username if the name of the user of organization creating the repository


Next clone our [our repository](https://github.com/landonma/datamanagement). Then place the  % necessary % files in your repository folder.

## Markdown editing
Markdown was created to be easy to read and edit. You can find a guide for using markdown [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Some additional tips for creating markdown documents:
* There must be a space after the ##'s when making headers
* There is NO space when bolding and using italics; ie. **bold** not ** bold **
* If you want to force a line break put two spaces at the end of the line then press Enter.
(ie. end of line." __ ")
* The table of contents links must be edited whenever a header name is changed and has a very specific format (ie. Quality Control must be typed *exactly* #quality-control to be linked correctly)

It is easiest to edit markdown files either by editing the documents uploaded into your repository through Github in a web browser or by using source code editing software such as Notepad++ or Atom (These docs were created using Atom). You could theoretically use Microsoft Word or Google Docs but it is strongly recommended that you use Github's editor instead.

## Using Our Template and Guide Documents
The template markdown file is meant to be edited and filled out directly. As you look through the template file you should fill in any _____ spaces and change any of the boiler-plate text with details specific for your project.  



The guidance document is meant to help you think about the important parts of each section and is **not** meant to be edited and published. This document will help illustrate what is important to include and consider in each section.
