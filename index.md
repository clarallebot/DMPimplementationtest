# How to Use This Repository
This repository contains the tools necessary to create a data management implementation plan and a webpage for your project. We have created template and guidance documents to allow you to easily create a plan specific for your project. We also walk you through using Github to set up a Github Pages webpage. The following steps contain links and instructions to help you through this process. After completing these steps you will have a data management plan and a working webpage for your research project.


## Set Up A Github Repository
Github is a website used to share data and allow multiple people to work on the same project. Github Pages is a newer feature which allows you to create webpages out of your repositories. You will need a Github account in order to complete this guide and can create one [here](hhttps://github.com/join)  
* Note: the url for the webpage will use either the username or organization name which sets it up.


Next you will need to create a new repository set up with Github pages by following the steps provided [here](https://pages.github.com/).  
* Note: Github pages does take some time to respond to new pages and edits so wait 3-5 minutes after making changes before assuming something went wrong
* Once a user or organization is set up to use Github pages, all their repositories will be navigable in a browser  

Next clone or download [our repository](https://github.com/landonma/datamanagement). Then place upload the template file into your own repository. ([Here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/) is a quick article if you are unfamiliar with Github)

## Markdown editing
Markdown was created to be easy to read and edit and we use this format for all the documents in this repository. Markdown files(.md) have some of the functionality of writing documents in an HTML format while still remaining easily readable. Github and Github Pages are set up to use Markdown already. The coding involved with formatting a Markdown document is easy to learn and you can find a guide for using markdown [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Some additional tips for creating markdown documents:
* There must be a space after the ##'s when making headers
* There is NO space when bolding and using italics; ie. **bold** not ** bold **
* If you want to force a line break put two spaces at the end of the line then press Enter.
(ie. end of line." __ ")
* The table of contents links must be edited whenever a header name is changed and has a very specific format (ie. Quality Control must be typed *exactly* #quality-control to be linked correctly)

It is easiest to edit markdown files either by editing the documents through Github in a web browser or by using source code editing software such as Notepad++ or Atom (these docs were created using Atom). You could theoretically use Microsoft Word or Google Docs but it is strongly recommended that you use Github's editor instead. To edit them using Github simply navigate to your repository, click on the file you want to edit and click the edit (pencil) button on the top right of the page.

## Using Our Template and Guide Documents
The template markdown file is meant to be edited and filled out directly. As you look through the template file you should fill in any _____ spaces and change any of the boiler-plate text with details specific for your project.  



The guidance document is meant to help you think about the important parts of each section and is **not** meant to be edited and published. This document will help illustrate what is important to include and consider in each section.
