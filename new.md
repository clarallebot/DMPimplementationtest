The policy directs faculty to submit an electronic copy of the author's accepted (post-peer review, pre-typeset) manuscript of their articles to OSU Libraries for dissemination via theScholarsArchive@OSUinstitutional repository. Oregon State University’s University Data Managmeent, Classification, and Incident Response policy can be found [here](https://is.oregonstate.edu/ois/data-management-and-classification-overview). It classifies data into Unrestricted, Sensitive and Confidential and defines standards of care for each kind to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.    Data Management Units
Instructions[Define datasets that will be created during this project, and group them according to different management needs.Describe relevant general information about the data groups: are they observational, experimental, simulation, model output or assimilation datasets; How will they be collected? How much data is expected?]TextX groups of datasets will be generated during the course of this project.1 –Dataset Group 1 [change name to more informative name]Type of dataset: [observational, experimental, simulation, model output, assimilation...]Collection strategy: ___Amount of data expected: ___2 –Dataset Group 2 [change name to more informative name]Type of dataset: [observational, experimental, simulation, model output, assimilation...]Collection strategy: ___Amount of data expected: ___Data CollectionInstructions[Information relevant to how data will be collected, captured or created]Sampling sites: [Include informationwith description of sampling sites including important data about them such as location, official names to be referred to, instrumentation in each sampling site, etc.]Existing protocols: [Include the location of protocols relevant to the researchthat already exist, like lab safety protocols, sampling protocols, instrument installation protocols, etc. Include here all the contextual information relevant for the use of the protocol that is not explained in the protocol itself]Name: [name of protocol]Location: [where to find the protocol]Expected use: [who should use the protocol, when]Training: [who will train new researchers. Who to ask when there are questions about the protocol.]New protocols:[For projects that involve the creation of routinely creating new protocols,describe the process of creating new protocols.]Process [Defines the process to create the protocol]Approval [Process to approve the protocol, and who should approve it]Tools [If special tools will be used to create the protocol, specify]
Storage [Where it should be saved, with which file naming strategy]Update [How to update the protocol]Expected use [Who should use the protocol, and for which circumstances]Instrumentation: [Include relevant information about the instruments that will be usedto collect data, like where to find instructions, maintenance to ensure that the sensors will work correctly, etc.]Software: [Include relevant information about the softwarethat will be used to generate data. Where to access the documentation. Intellectual property information about the softwareto be aware of.]Data DocumentationInstructions[Describe how data will be documented throughout the project]TextData will be documented throughout the research processusing the following tools:Lab notebooks[If the project will use lab notebooks to document their lab procedures, include here best practices to keep them in the lab]Details about experiments and work in a lab are quickly forgotten unless they are written down. Be diligent in writing information into notebooks. Follow best practices:•Lab notebooks will always be bound notebooks. Blank notebooks can be found in ___. Number and date the notebook when you begin with a new one. •Pages should always be numbered.•Write legiblyand in a language understood by everybody in the lab.•Error correction:incorrect information should be visible, but clearly marked as incorrect. Date, sign and explain the correction. Do not erase entries or blot them out. •Printed documentation added to the lab notebook should be attached permanently.•Note where all electronic files associated with the experiment are located.•All entries should be consecutive. Always record dates.•Backup: at the end of the day ___ [scan, photograph...] the pages of the notebook that you worked on, and store them in ___ Data standards[If the project will use data standards and/or metadata standards, include here information about the standards, and where to find information about using them correctly.]Templates[If the project will usetemplates to document datasets, include here instructions about whereto find the templates and how to use them]
Readme[If the project will be documented using readme files, include expectations about where they will be created, and which information will be recorded in them.]Quality ControlInstructions[Most data need to go through a quality control process. Describe the process here, and describe how it will be documented.For ideas around defining levels of quality control, see the Guidance Document.] File Organizationand file namingInstructions[Details about the organization of data files in shared or privatefolders. What name to give to  folders? What kind of filesshould be savedin each folder?Design file naming techniques so that file names are informative for all files, and consistent throughout the folders, regardless of the person creating the file.]FormatsInstructions[Describe preferred formatsto save information and data. Describe situations in which files should be changed from one format to a different one.See the guidance document for a list of preferred formats for long term preservation.]StorageBackupWorkflow Internal Data SharingData UseProtection for Sensitive and Confidential DataManagement of Physical SamplesData PublicationData Archival
